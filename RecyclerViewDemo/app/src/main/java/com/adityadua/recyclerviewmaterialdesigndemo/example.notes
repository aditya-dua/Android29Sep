So any list which you are creating on your own and are not using any of the android
capablities is called a CUSTOM LIST.

How we make a list ?


ArrayAdaptor<String>  arrayAdaptor = new ArrayAdaptor<string> (
this,android.R.ulayout.simple_list_item_1,array)

only a string si thats why a TextView

custom list : I might have say 3 view (Image View , Buttob , Text View)
